# Flights delay dataset- Data analysis and Data modelling

The aim of this project is to summarize the exploratory data analysis and data modelling performed on
the flights dataset. There are three files-csv file of the flights data, python notebook detailing the analysis and modelling and a report which draws insights and makes suitable
assumptions/conclusions on the results obtained in the notebook. The python file will act as a
supporting document for this report. The dataset consists of domestic flight details from 2015.
